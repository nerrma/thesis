* Ideas
- L1 sparsity - only do operations on the supports (relevant features) to cut costs.
- Neural networks as the learning task.
  - https://github.com/amirgholami/PyHessian
- Is it better than validation for costly operations?
- Stopping criterion based on IACV - possibly more robust than tolerance/threshold based methods.
